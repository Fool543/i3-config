# i3-config
i3 configs for starters . 
It is still not complete . I mainly made this repo to make my work easier and to document it 

# Installation
Run 'chmod +x install.sh' & './install.sh' commands to install essential programs . Just run it even if you think you have installed everything . Press y for every time it asks. 

# Starting i3 with my custom theme
Just run 'chmod +x start.sh' & 'startx i3'
